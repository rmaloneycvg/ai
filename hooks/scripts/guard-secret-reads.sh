# Trigger: PreToolUse on read_file / read_files
# Exit 0 = allow, Exit 2 = block (returns STDERR to LLM)
#
# This restores the protection that the `fs_read: deny` block in permissions.yaml
# used to provide, WITHOUT the side effect that blanket-denied the scan tools
# (grep_search, file_search, list_directory). Those tools present a pattern or
# directory scope the policy engine cannot prove disjoint from the deny globs, so
# it failed closed and denied them. This hook only inspects concrete resolved
# paths on read_file/read_files, leaving pattern-based scans untouched.
