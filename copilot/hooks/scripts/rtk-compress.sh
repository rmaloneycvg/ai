# RTK interceptor — compress output of READ-ONLY, rtk-supported commands before it enters context.
# Trigger: PreToolUse on shell. Returns the compressed result to the model via STDERR + exit 2.
#
# SAFETY MODEL (why this is scoped to read-only):
#   A PreToolUse command hook runs its commands as a SUBPROCESS of the hook, i.e. OUTSIDE Kiro's
#   permission layer and other hooks. So we ONLY ever execute commands that are:
#     (1) one of rtk's supported binaries, (2) free of any mutation/side-effect keyword,
#     (3) free of shell metacharacters (pipes/redirects/sub-shells), (4) for `aws`, a read verb only,
#     (5) confirmed rewritable by `rtk rewrite` (its own support oracle).
#   Anything else → exit 0, and Kiro runs it through its NORMAL gated path (permissions.yaml +
#   guard-destructive-commands), where the steering rule to prefix `rtk` still applies.
